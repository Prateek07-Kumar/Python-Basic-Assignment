Model-based system learn by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predicitons on new data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make a prediction, a new instance's features are fed into a hypothesis function which uses the minimized theta found by repeatedly running the cost function."
